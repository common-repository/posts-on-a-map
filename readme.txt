Add a custom field for GPS coordinates in the post editor and show a map under under the content of the post.

== Description ==

This plugin is intended for travel blogs, hiking blogs, where you want to show a map of a location you are writing about.

It's really simple. It just adds an extra field in the Wordpress admin editor, and if you enter GPS coordinates, it will add a map in the bottom of the post.

Acceptable types of GPS coordinate formats:

* N 45° 46.000 E 014° 12.000

* S 45° 46' 1" W 014° 12' 1"

* +46° 22' 38.11", -96° 9' 55.90"

* N 45.766667 E 014.200000

* -45.766667,014.200000
